# terminator-k8s-plugin

This is a work in progress, the ultimate goal is to provide k8s specific informations in the shell title bar like:
- which cluster your on
- what namespace is currently active

Feel free to open issues for feature requests

## TODO

- Installation instructions
- Getting current namespace from kube config
